# Restaurant

This project appears to be a website for a restaurant named <b>"Coco's Kitchen."</b> The website consists of several sections, each serving a specific purpose. Let me describe each section briefly:

<b> Reservation Modal Form:</b>
<h6>The code starts with a modal form, presumably for users to make reservations.
It includes fields for the user's name, date, time, email, number of guests, and an additional message.
There are buttons to cancel the reservation and to book the table.</h6>

<b> Header Section:</b>
<h6>The header section includes a welcome message, a brief description, and a video about Coco's Kitchen.
It provides buttons to navigate to different sections of the website.</h6>

<b> Menu Section:</b>
<h6>This section displays the menu of the restaurant.
It is organized into tabs for different categories of dishes, such as starters, specials, lunch, dinner, and desserts.
Each tab contains images and names of various menu items.</h6>

<b> Service Section:</b>
<h6>This section provides information about the services offered by Coco's Kitchen.
It includes descriptions of buffet, package delivery, and takeout services.
Each service has an associated image.</h6>
  
<b> Gallery Section:</b>
<h6>This section showcases a gallery of images related to the restaurant.
It uses a slider with images that can be clicked to view in a lightbox.</h6>

<b> Team Section:</b>
<h6>The team section introduces the staff or chefs working at Coco's Kitchen.
It displays images of team members along with their names, positions, and social media links.</h6>

<b> Review Section:</b>
<h6>This section features customer reviews displayed in a carousel.
Each review includes an image, a rating, and a textual review.
Users can navigate through the reviews using carousel controls.</h6>

Overall, this project combines functionality for users to make reservations, learn about the restaurant's menu and services, view a gallery of images, and read customer reviews. The website aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Coco's Kitchen and encourage user engagement.
